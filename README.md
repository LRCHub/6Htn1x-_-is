[00:00.01] I'm sorry, but don't wanna talk
[00:04.39] I need a moment 'fore I go
[00:09.31] It's nothing personal
[00:12.83] I draw the blinds
[00:15.07] They don't need to see me cry
[00:18.26] 'Cause even if they understand
[00:21.42] They don't understand
[00:31.92] 
[00:25.72] So then when I'm finished
[00:27.78] I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
[00:31.89] I'm takin' my misery
[00:33.80] Make it my bitch, can't be everyone's favourite girl
[00:59.80] 
[00:38.13] So, take aim and fire away
[00:42.06] I've never been so wide awake
[00:45.66] No, nobody but me can keep me safe
[00:49.29] And I'm on my way
[00:51.12] The blood moon is on the rise
[00:54.28] The fire burning in my eyes
[00:58.08] No, nobody but me can keep me safe
[01:01.96] And I'm on my way
[01:10.46] 
[01:28.43] Lo siento mucho, pero me voy (eh)
[01:34.83] Porque a tu lado, me di cuenta que nada soy (eh-ey)
[01:40.44] Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
[01:43.97] De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
[01:47.45] Acepto mis errore', también soy humano
[01:50.19] Y tú no ve' que lo hago porque te amo (pum-pum-pum-pum)
[02:17.69] 
[01:53.88] Pero ya (ya), no tengo más na' que hacer aquí (aquí)
[01:59.63] Me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir (partir)
[02:02.56] De mi propio camino, seguiré lejos de ti
[02:22.56] 
[02:07.10] So, take aim and fire away
[02:10.47] I've never been so wide awake
[02:13.69] No, nobody but me can keep me safe
[02:17.81] And I'm on my way
[02:19.37] The blood moon is on the rise (is on the rise, na-na)
[02:22.80] The fire burning in my eyes (the fire burning in my eyes, na)
[02:26.75] No, nobody but me can keep me safe
[02:30.24] And I'm on my way
[02:38.74] 
[02:44.05] (I'm on my way)
[02:45.87] (Hey, boy, ever been, everybody keep me safe)
[02:51.87] (Hey, boy, ever been, everybody keep me safe)
[02:57.84] (Hey, boy, ever been, everybody keep me safe)
[03:04.37] (Hey, boy, ever been)
[03:07.47] (Everybody, everybody on my way)
[03:23.47] 
[03:09.78] So, take aim and fire away
[03:13.23] I've never been so wide awake
[03:16.73] No, nobody but me can keep me safe
[03:21.28] And I'm on my way
[03:23.66] The blood moon is on the rise
[03:26.52] The fire burning in my eyes
[03:29.77] No, nobody but me can keep me safe
[03:34.22] And I'm on my way
